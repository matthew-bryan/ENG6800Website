title: "Writing and Rhetoric Foundations"
---

Writing and Rhetoric Foundations will introduce students to some of the key concepts, values, and habits of mind associated with the academic discipline known as Writing Studies (or, alternatively, "Rhetoric and Composition" or "Composition Studies"). You might be asking yourself something along the lines of, "What is there to study about writing?" While activities such as writing and reading might seem intuitive, it turns out they are more complex than they might initially seem. These activities are highly contextual and bound up with identities and values in important ways. To investigate writing and rhetoric is to examine how individuals interpret, think, communicate, argue, and make meaning as they move through the world. This course, then, will teach you to think like a writing researcher in order to become a more empowered and more critical writer, reader, and thinker yourself.

Drawing on Linda Adler-Kassner and Elizabeth Wardle's 2015 work Naming What We Know: Threshold Concepts of Writing Studies, this course is centered around five threshold concepts. Threshold concepts are those "concepts critical for continued learning and participation in an area or within a community of practice" (Adler-Kassner and Wardle 2). Think of these as the big ideas that are integral to how members of a particular community see the world and do their work. Indeed, members of a community tend to believe these ideas so completely that they almost take them for granted. The five threshold concepts of Writing Studies identified by Adler-Kassner and Wardle and their colleagues are...

- Writing is a social and rhetorical activity.
- Writing speaks to situations through recognizable forms.
- Writing enacts and creates identities and ideologies.
- All writers have more to learn.
- Writing is (also always) a cognitive activity.
  
Adler-Kassner and Wardle also identify an overarching concept that serves to support all of the others: "Writing itself is an activity and a subject of study." This understanding that writing can be investigated, questioned, and probed at like any other research subject will drive our work this semester. As both Adler-Kassner and Royster highlight in the quotes at the top of this syllabus, writing and understandings of writing, language, and literacy are neither static nor universal. This semester, then, we will consider our ethical responsibility as communicators, audiences, and individuals with writing expertise to understand and critically interrogate the consequences of how particular conceptions of writing and language are constructed, imposed, and valued (or not).

### Why Does This Matter to Me?
This course is intended to serve three particular student populations:

1. Writing and Rhetoric major, minor, or certificate students early in their coursework. For these students, this course will provide some foundational concepts, methods, and practice in writing that they can continue to build on in future courses.
2. Writing and Rhetoric major, minor, or certificate students later in their coursework. For these students, this course will provide the opportunity to pull together what they have learned and develop means of taking advantage of this knowledge and practice going forward.
3. Students from other majors taking this course as an elective. For these students, this course will serve as introduction to some of the ideas from the discipline of Writing Studies, with a focus on strategies and tools that they can use to interrogate, investigate, and succeed on their own terms in the writing situations they may encounter in the future, either in the university or in other professional, civic, and/or social contexts.

While this course will introduce students to some of the key concepts and questions from the field of Writing Studies—including looking at some academic research on writing, rhetoric, and literacy—our focus will not be on theory. Instead, we will look to this research for ideas we can take up and use ourselves, both in our writing this semester and beyond.

## Course Objectives

Through the work in this course, students will...

- define concepts that help them to understand how writing and rhetoric work in and across different contexts, such as literacy, rhetorical situation, discourse community, and genre.
- build a working knowledge of key analytical frameworks and research methods of Writing Studies and rhetorical theory, learning how to deploy them to advance students' own writing and research goals.
- examine the links between writing, identities, and values.
- analyze the rhetorical moves used within and across different texts, genres, and communities in order to ethically engage with different writers, audiences, and rhetorical situations.
- develop an awareness of how writing functions to produce and sustain knowledge within different communities and settings.
- learn to flexibly adapt and assess their own writing and writing choices—including invention, style, arrangement, and integration of sources—in order to meet their goals across the shifting conventions of changing disciplinary, non-academic, and civic discourse communities.
- heighten self-awareness of their potential to meaningfully inform and shape—by drawing on their own experiences and their developing expertise as writers, rhetoricians, and researchers—conversations about writing, literacy, and rhetoric as well as writing and literacy practices used in institutional, academic, civic, and other contexts.
- expand and refine their primary and secondary research skills.
- build confidence in their individual writing expertise and rhetorical knowledge
