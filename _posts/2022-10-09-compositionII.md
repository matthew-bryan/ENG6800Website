title: "Composition II"

Composition II seeks to extend the transferable knowledge about writing students developed in Composition I. As with Composition I, Composition II is based in the notion that experts in the field of Writing Studies have developed ways of thinking about how writing works that can usefully inform students’ own thinking about writing. It is not, then, a research course in the traditional sense; instead, it is a course about writing that treats inquiry as a means of developing student knowledge about writing. 

### So, what will we be doing?
Our work this semester will revolve around conducting research into writing, how it works, and how it is used by groups of people to get things done. This is, of course, a broad set of topics, so our work will begin by thinking about specific research areas and questions that are interesting and relevant to you. Through both your research and your writing, you'll get practical experience in conducting research, studying and writing in different genres, and collaboration, both with peers and the authors you'll read.

While this is, at its heart, a class about research, you might find that the nature of the research you’ll be doing in this course is different from some of the research you’ve done before. Instead of treating research merely as a means to an end (i.e. you need to find evidence and “facts” to support your argument), we’ll treat research as a generative process of genuine inquiry, meaning you’ll ask and try to find answers to difficult questions that haven’t been answered yet. In pursuing these questions, you’ll actually create new knowledge, which can be quite exciting. We’ll also consider the ways in which ideas and language circulate and develop in order to figure out how you might actually use and publish the research you’ve conducted.

To get a fuller idea of the sort of writing and research we'll be doing, check out some of the ENC 1102 articles that have been published previously in [*Stylus: A Journal of First-Year Writing*](https://cah.ucf.edu/writingrhetoric/stylus/). These are from different classes so you'll see some variance in subject and approach, but these articles should give you a sense of where we'll be heading this semester with your research projects.

## Course Objectives

- **Writing Processes & Adaptation**: Students will be able to describe and reflect on writing processes in order to flexibly adapt them to support their goals.

- **Multiple Literacies & Goal Setting**: Students will be able to demonstrate how they marshal/leverage their multiple literacies (e.g. speaking, listening, reading, multilingual writing, translating, multimodality, etc.) to support their writing processes.

- **Variation across Contexts**: Students will be able to identify, analyze, and reflect on variation in rhetorical and linguistic patterns, including their own, from a range of contexts (e.g cultural, digital, workplace, and/or academic).

- **Decision Making & Production**: Students will be able to produce writing that demonstrates their ability to navigate choices and constraints when writing for specific audiences, genres, and purposes.

- **Writing and Power**: Students will be able to critically examine and act on the relationship among identity, literacy, language, and power.

- **Revision**: Students will be able to negotiate differences in and act with intention on feedback from readers when drafting, revising, and editing their writing.
