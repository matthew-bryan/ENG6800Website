<p>Composition I emphasizes how writing works within and across communities, genres, processes, and languages to assist students in responding to today’s writing scenes. Students can expect to engage with declarative (content and conceptual) and procedural (performance and process) knowledge related to all aspects of composing. Students will name and then connect writing-related knowledge with writing-related practices to better understand, strengthen, extend, and transform their diverse literacy and language practices for future use. The reading and writing tasks in Composition I—such as analyses of writing processes and goal setting, identifying and producing genres responsive to rhetorical and linguistic variation, and gaining control over revision strategies—provide frameworks for effective and deliberate approaches to composing in the university and beyond.</p>

<p>I like to think of this class, then, as a writing class about writing itself. We’ll study various forms and reasons for writing, the social interactions surroundings its uses, and the individual processes we use when generating text. By better understanding how writing—especially your own—actually works, you can take control of the variety of writing situations you’ll face both in college and in your career. As such, this is not an English course in the traditional sense; we will not be discussing literature and we will not spend much—if any—time on grammar or mechanical concerns. Instead, our work here builds out of the scholarly discipline of Writing Studies, so we’ll treat writing as both a tool used to coordinate and conduct a myriad of activities and an object that is itself worthy of scrutiny and analysis.</p>

<h3 id="but-how-can-i-use-this-in-my-real-life">“But how can I use this in my real life?”</h3>
<p>That’s a question I get asked all of the time. And it’s a great question, one that you should really keep asking as you make your way through college. When it comes to this class, the answer is fairly simple: no matter what you do, you’re going to write and that writing will matter. We can’t predict with complete accuracy what that writing will look like—a family physician obviously writes different sorts of texts than an aerospace engineer, but they both write frequently—though it’s a pretty safe bet that it won’t look like a five-paragraph essay. Instead of trying to teach you how to write, then, we’ll focus on learning about writing. That way, you’ll have some acquired some useful skills and ideas about how writing works that should help you in those writing situations that matter more to you.</p>
