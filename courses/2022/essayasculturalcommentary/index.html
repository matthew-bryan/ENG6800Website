<meta name="description" content="When you hear “essay,” what do you think of? If your reaction is less than positive, you’re not alone. The term “essay” can be problematic in that it is used to refer to any number of genres and sub-genres of writing, from memoir to literary journalism to a report on a scientific study to the research paper you wrote in 10th grade. In particular, “essay” has often come to be associated with testing in school, as in something you write to demonstrate mastery over a subject. This linkage, however, is a disservice to the actual essay genre and its rich history. An essay as classically understood is a trial, a writer’s attempt to understand something. The subjects and approaches vary, but essays as we will study them in this course are driven by curiosity and a willingness to engage with the world, other minds, and different perspectives." />

<p>When you hear “essay,” what do you think of? If your reaction is less than positive, you’re not alone. The term “essay” can be problematic in that it is used to refer to any number of genres and sub-genres of writing, from memoir to literary journalism to a report on a scientific study to the research paper you wrote in 10th grade. In particular, “essay” has often come to be associated with testing in school, as in something you write to demonstrate mastery over a subject. This linkage, however, is a disservice to the actual essay genre and its rich history. An essay as classically understood is a trial, a writer’s attempt to understand something. The subjects and approaches vary, but essays as we will study them in this course are driven by curiosity and a willingness to engage with the world, other minds, and different perspectives.</p>

<p>This course will provide the opportunity to consider the origins of the essay genre and its contemporary offshoots. Rather than take a purely literary approach, our focus will be rhetorical. As such, we will read essays to think about what makes them work and especially serve to provide cultural commentary. You will also have a chance to try your hand at writing some essays of your own.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-this-matter-to-me">Why Does This Matter to Me?</h3>
<p>That’s an important question and, rather than try to convince you here that you should be as passionate and interested in the essay genre as I am, I hope you’ll be able to answer this question for yourself as the semester progresses. Still, here are a few possible reasons to begin thinking about:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The essay as a genre is centuries old, and yet still amazingly current. The first decades of the twenty-first century have seen a relative explosion in the number of essays being published (thanks, in large part, to internet publications and reading communities).</li>
  <li>Cultural commentary can be thought-provoking—stimulating real change and awareness—and also just plain fun to read and write.</li>
  <li>Understanding the moves by which the essayist establishes authority on the page can be helpful for just about any writer. It’s a useful site in which to study rhetoric.</li>
  <li>This is an inquiry-driven course, so rather than rely solely on definitions and theories produced by others, we’ll work together to develop some of our own ideas about essays and commentary. Through this process, it’s my hope that you’ll come to see that writing is itself a process of discovery, and there’s no better genre to facilitate this process than the essay.</li>
</ol>
