<p>Composition II seeks to extend the transferable knowledge about writing students developed in Composition I. As with Composition I, Composition II is based in the notion that experts in the field of Writing Studies have developed ways of thinking about how writing works that can usefully inform students’ own thinking about writing. It is not, then, a research course in the traditional sense; instead, it is a course about writing that treats inquiry as a means of developing student knowledge about writing.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-will-we-be-doing">So, what will we be doing?</h3>
<p>Our work this semester will revolve around conducting research into writing, how it works, and how it is used by groups of people to get things done. This is, of course, a broad set of topics, so our work will begin by thinking about specific research areas and questions that are interesting and relevant to you. Through both your research and your writing, you’ll get practical experience in conducting research, studying and writing in different genres, and collaboration, both with peers and the authors you’ll read.</p>

<p>While this is, at its heart, a class about research, you might find that the nature of the research you’ll be doing in this course is different from some of the research you’ve done before. Instead of treating research merely as a means to an end (i.e. you need to find evidence and “facts” to support your argument), we’ll treat research as a generative process of genuine inquiry, meaning you’ll ask and try to find answers to difficult questions that haven’t been answered yet. In pursuing these questions, you’ll actually create new knowledge, which can be quite exciting. We’ll also consider the ways in which ideas and language circulate and develop in order to figure out how you might actually use and publish the research you’ve conducted.</p>

<p>To get a fuller idea of the sort of writing and research we’ll be doing, check out some of the ENC 1102 articles that have been published previously in <a href="https://cah.ucf.edu/writingrhetoric/stylus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Stylus: A Journal of First-Year Writing</em></a>. These are from different classes so you’ll see some variance in subject and approach, but these articles should give you a sense of where we’ll be heading this semester with your research projects.</p>

<h2 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h2>

<p>Through the work in this course, students will…</p>

<ul>
  <li>evaluate and synthesize scholarly work from the discipline of Writing Studies in ways that demonstrate an understanding of the situated and intertextual nature of writing and research.</li>
  <li>formulate a specific, meaningful research question that is appropriate both to the Writing Studies-related problem at the center of the course and the scope/timeframe of a single semester.</li>
  <li>engage in a recursive, inquiry-based research process using appropriate Writing Studies methodology.</li>
  <li>collaborate with classmates and instructor to interpret data and findings using discipline-specific analytical tools and frameworks.</li>
  <li>develop and communicate arguments utilizing data and findings through typical Writing Studies research genres (including conference proposals, abstracts, and scholarly articles).</li>
  <li>revise their writing and research products over time in response to peer and instructor feedback.</li>
  <li>examine their own conceptions of writing and language in response to their inquiry, reading, and writing throughout the course.</li>
  <li>learn about ways to get involved with further research at UCF and beyond.</li>
</ul>
