    <h2><a href="/ENG6800Website/courses/2022/compositionI/">Composition I</a></h2>
    <p>Composition I emphasizes how writing works within and across communities, genres, processes, and languages to assist students in responding to today’s writing scenes. Students can expect to engage with declarative (content and conceptual) and procedural (performance and process) knowledge related to all aspects of composing. Students will name and then connect writing-related knowledge with writing-related practices to better understand, strengthen, extend, and transform their diverse literacy and language practices for future use. The reading and writing tasks in Composition I—such as analyses of writing processes and goal setting, identifying and producing genres responsive to rhetorical and linguistic variation, and gaining control over revision strategies—provide frameworks for effective and deliberate approaches to composing in the university and beyond.
</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/ENG6800Website/courses/2022/compositionII/">Composition II</a></h2>
    <p>Composition II seeks to extend the transferable knowledge about writing students developed in Composition I. As with Composition I, Composition II is based in the notion that experts in the field of Writing Studies have developed ways of thinking about how writing works that can usefully inform students’ own thinking about writing. It is not, then, a research course in the traditional sense; instead, it is a course about writing that treats inquiry as a means of developing student knowledge about writing.
</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/ENG6800Website/courses/2022/essayasculturalcommentary/">Essay as Cultural Commentary</a></h2>
    <p>When you hear “essay,” what do you think of? If your reaction is less than positive, you’re not alone. The term “essay” can be problematic in that it is used to refer to any number of genres and sub-genres of writing, from memoir to literary journalism to a report on a scientific study to the research paper you wrote in 10th grade. In particular, “essay” has often come to be associated with testing in school, as in something you write to demonstrate mastery over a subject. This linkage, however, is a disservice to the actual essay genre and its rich history. An essay as classically understood is a trial, a writer’s attempt to understand something. The subjects and approaches vary, but essays as we will study them in this course are driven by curiosity and a willingness to engage with the world, other minds, and different perspectives.
</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/ENG6800Website/courses/2022/foundations/">Writing and Rhetoric Foundations</a></h2>
    <p>Writing and Rhetoric Foundations will introduce students to some of the key concepts, values, and habits of mind associated with the academic discipline known as Writing Studies (or, alternatively, “Rhetoric and Composition” or “Composition Studies”). You might be asking yourself something along the lines of, “What is there to study about writing?” While activities such as writing and reading might seem intuitive, it turns out they are more complex than they might initially seem. These activities are highly contextual and bound up with identities and values in important ways. To investigate writing and rhetoric is to examine how individuals interpret, think, communicate, argue, and make meaning as they move through the world. This course, then, will teach you to think like a writing researcher in order to become a more empowered and more critical writer, reader, and thinker yourself.
