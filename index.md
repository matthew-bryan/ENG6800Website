I'm currently a senior lecturer in the [Department of Writing and Rhetoric at the University of Central Florida](https://cah.ucf.edu/writingrhetoric/), where I also serve as assistant director of the [University Writing Center](https://uwc.cah.ucf.edu/). 

My training is in creative writing, and I still write both essays and stories. My research has been focused in the areas of writing program administration and writing center studies. You can check out my latest work at [my Projects page](_pages/projects.md).

Please reach out if you're interested in collaborating!
