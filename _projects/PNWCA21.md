## Empty Spaces that Are Still Full: Reading a Writing Center’s Spaces and Objects through Mediated Discourse Theory
============

This page includes materials from a presentation I created for the 2021 Pacific Northwest Writing Centers Association conference. Here, I apply mediated discoure theory as a means of beginning to "read" some of the spaces in our writing center, empty (of people) as they were in light of remote operations taking place during the pandemic.

I continued this research with a team of undergraduates and the director of our writing center, which culminated in a presentation at the 2021 International Writing Center Association conference.
